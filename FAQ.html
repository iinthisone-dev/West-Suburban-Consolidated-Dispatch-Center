                    <h3>Why does the 9-1-1 Telecommunicator ask so many questions? Isn’t this delaying help being sent to me?</h3>
                    <p>The Telecommunicator is trained to ask questions for police, fire, and medical calls. They ask to provide as much information as possible to responders for their and your safety, and so responders can efficiently help when they arrive. Telecommunicators can also give potentially life-saving instructions over the phone before responders arrive. Asking questions does not delay help — the Computer-Aided-Dispatch (CAD) system allows dispatchers to work together so calls and dispatching occur in parallel.</p>

                    <h3>How do I become a 9-1-1 Telecommunicator?</h3>
                    <p>WSCDC posts available positions on this website. The hiring process may include application, orientation, basic skills test, typing test, interview, background checks, psychological testing, and medical examination. A high school diploma is required; a college degree is preferred. Typing speed of 35 WPM is usually required.</p>

                    <h3>When I dial 9-1-1 why doesn’t my call get answered by my police department?</h3>
                    <p>The communities served by WSCDC have consolidated dispatching. Telecommunicators at WSCDC answer your 9-1-1 call and dispatch the necessary resources for police, fire, or EMS. Consolidation brings financial and operational efficiencies and allows coordinated response across participating communities.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Why does the Telecommunicator always ask me if I want to speak to the officer?</h3>
                    <p>Some citizens want to sign a complaint and some do not. The officer will still respond to investigate, but the Telecommunicator asks whether you wish to speak to the officer after the investigation is complete. If you do not want to speak with the officer, say so and the Telecommunicator will inform the officer.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Why does the Telecommunicator ask me for my address? Isn’t it right there on the screen?</h3>
                    <p>When receiving a land-line 9-1-1 call, Telecommunicators receive the caller's address and phone number. For cell phone calls, they receive lat/long coordinates that translate to an address. It is national standard to ask and then verify the location — if responders are sent to the wrong place, they cannot help. Verifying the address is critical.</p>
